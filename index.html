<br>I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/">The Chinese University of Hong Kong</a>, working in the <a
	href="https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/">the department of statistics</a>, advised by <a
	href="https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/hywong/">Professor Wong Hoi Ying</a>. Before joining Prof. Wong's team,
        I received my bachelor's degree in Statistics from Sun Yat-Sen University in 2023. I feel fortunate to get instructions
        about survival analysis and causal inference from <a 
	href="https://sites.google.com/site/yingyanuw/">Professor Yan Ying</a>. <br><br>

I was born and brought up in Jie Yang, Guang dong Province, China Mainland. I speak Mandarin and English and I am learning
Cantonese to ease my life in Hong Kong.
