<br>I obtained MPhil in statistics from <a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/">The Chinese University of Hong Kong</a>, working in the <a
	href="https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/">the department of statistics</a>, supervised by <a
	href="https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/hywong/">Professor Wong Hoi Ying</a>, <a
	href="https://www.med.cuhk.edu.hk/staff/professor-wong-lai-hung-grace/">Professor Wong Lai Hung</a>, and <a
	href="https://mdac.cuhk.edu.hk/members/dr-terry-cheuk-fung-yip/">Professor Cheuk-Fung Yip</a>. Before CUHK,
        I received my bachelor's degree in Statistics from Sun Yat-Sen University in 2023. I feel fortunate to get instructions
        about survival analysis and causal inference from <a 
	href="https://sites.google.com/site/yingyanuw/">Professor Yan Ying</a>. <br><br>

I was born and brought up in Jie Yang, Guang dong Province, China Mainland. I speak Mandarin and English and I am learning
Cantonese to ease my life in Hong Kong.
